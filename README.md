## Program run instruction
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the python and navigate to the code directory
3. task_space_impedance_control

A basic version of task-space impedance control that utilizes the pseudoinverse method for redundancy resolution.

4. Impedance_optimization

Our proposed **Torque Distribution-Based Optimization Framework** to enhance torque distribution and optimize task-space impedance control.
